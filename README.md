## About our App

We have developed an application that empowers our users to enhance their productivity by efficiently organizing and dividing tasks, primarily achieved through the creation of notes using our application. This enables users to have a comprehensive view of their calendar with notes categorized under different topics. Users can seamlessly create new notes and remove existing ones as needed.

## Installation & Usage

- Go to your forked repo, it will now say `<your-github-username>Revision-App`.

#### Terminal commands (GITBASH FOR WINDOW USERS OR TERMINAL FOR MAC USERS)
